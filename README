= Moshy : a simple Mosh wrapper with profile settings
:author: Kevin Roy <kiniou@gmail.com>

== Introduction

Moshy is a simple python script which allow a user to connect to mosh
server with different settings per hosts like port ranges or commands
to run immediately once logged in.

== Installation

Moshy depends on the followings:

* Python 3
* docopt


After a successful clone of *moshy* repository, you can simply install
*moshy* with the following command:

    pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt


== Configuration

Moshy wraps mosh in order to use configuration profiles from the
following path:

    /etc/moshy.conf                  # System configuration
    ${HOME}/.config/moshy/moshy.conf # Per-user configuration
    ${HOME}/.moshy.conf              # Per-user configuration


You can select a profile by passing +<hostname>+ argument and extra arguments
which will be executed to the remote mosh session.

== TODO
Track down weird bug re: capitalization in profile name, or domain name (pulled from ~/.ssh/config)
- causes moshy to bjork and misfire; that is: connect with invalid/default params

The +<hostname>+ parameter match configuration sections and can be formatted like
the following:

    hostname             - connect to a remote hostname
    user@hostname        - connect a specific user to connect with
    hostname:flavor
    user@hostname:flavor - 'flavor' is an arbitrary name that can be
                           used to reference your commands.

You can simply list configured profiles by using the +list+ command and get
more information on profile configured.
